## Instructions
This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

#### Data Modeling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBDLinks to an external site..

#### Data Engineering
